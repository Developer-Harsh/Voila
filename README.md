The app "Voila" is designed to be a versatile communication platform, offering users the ability to connect via chat and video calls. Built with an intuitive interface, Voila aimed to provide real-time messaging powered by Firestore and seamless video call functionality. While the development was nearly complete, with most features implemented, the final touches, including the integration of the Firestore realtime chat system and the addition of a dedicated call screen, remain unfinished due to unforeseen personal circumstances. Voila's potential as a communication tool is evident, and with these final elements in place, it could become a powerful solution for staying connected.
